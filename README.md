# sba-2-java-script-fundamentals

This is my second SBA project at Perscholas to showcase my understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript. I have created 2 files. one as a draft (working document) and the other as a final sba project. This project involves object and array manipulation, retreival of items in an array or properties in an object. I've also used functions to handle repeated tasks and committed to github often.
